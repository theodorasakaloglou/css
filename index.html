        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h_gVop4kbKLiu0nxvVn2ewa3sCNTpIbG/view?usp=drive_link">Visit My First Assignment!</a>
        <p>In this assignment, we were challenged to think algorithmically, designing a process that could be turned into a set of precise instructions(a pesudocode) and handed to someone else to complete the task. The focus was on how clearly and logically the guide was formed, ensuring that anyone following it would achieve the intentional result.</p>

        <p>This assignment helped us become comfortable with tools in p5.js, such as randomness, and challenged us to recreate a geometric figure described by The Location Of Six Geometric Figures by Sol LeWitt, keeping a parametric approach in mind for its design.</p>

        <h5>Third Assignment</h5>
        <p>This assignment aimed to engage us with tools like arrays,loops,recursion,conditionals and functions, encouraging us to use our imagination and creativity to utilize them to develop parametric relations and create interactive design.</p>
